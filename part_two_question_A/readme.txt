Use this program to refactor the values of the **Roles** key in a JSON file using NodeJS.

- Move all JSON files that need to be refactored to the **input** folder
- Open a command terminal that points to the root of this project folder

- Enter the following into the command line: 
    `node index.js inputFilename outputFilename`

**NOTE:** You can replace *inputFilename* and *outputFilename* with your desired names. The folder locations and extensions are already set.
**Use 'Test1' or 'Test2" as inputFilename for testing purposes.**

- The **output** folder will now contain the refactored JSON data
- Repeat as needed for any remaining files
